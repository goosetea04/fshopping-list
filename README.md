## Assignment 7

### What are the main differences between stateless and stateful widgets in Flutter?

Stateless widgets in Flutter are immutable, meaning their properties cannot change once they are created. They do not have any internal state that can be modified. Stateless widgets are typically used for displaying static content that doesn't change based on user interactions or other factors. Because they are immutable, they are considered lightweight and can be more efficient in terms of performance. Examples of stateless widgets include Container, Text, and Icon. When you need to display information that doesn't change, using a stateless widget is a good choice. 

On the other hand, stateful widgets are mutable and can change their properties and appearance over time in response to user interactions or other factors. They have an associated State object that can be modified, and the widget can rebuild itself in response to changes in its state. Stateful widgets are used for dynamic content that can change based on user input, network requests, and other events. Examples of stateful widgets include ListView, Form, and TextField. They are essential for creating interactive and dynamic user interfaces in Flutter applications.
